# paxjs
This is a javascript implementation and simulation of Paxos. The library Paxos includes Proposers, Acceptors, and a Learner.
When starting the program, a variable number of proposers and acceptors may be chosen.
The simulation Spanner will log when a consensus for the learn has been made.

TO RUN THE PROGRAM:
Go to src folder and call "./run.sh x" where x is the number of nodes you would like in the system. The more nodes, the more acceptors you will have.
